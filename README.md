# gminer-autostart
If the computer is inactive for more than 15 minutes, the application starts the miner, but when the mouse moves, it turns off and starts counting up to 15 minutes again.

In order for everything to work, you will need to place gminer in the script folder.

To run you need libraries: pywin32 , os , popen .

Edit Popen("mine_eth.bat") to your type if you want to mine another coin. <3
